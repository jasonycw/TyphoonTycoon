<h1>How to Play</h1>

<h2>Aim</h2>

<p>To prevent typhoons from reaching your city (Hong Kong), damaging its stock market.</p>

<h2>HSI (HS Index)</h2>

<p>This is the health of the stock market (stock price).<br>
It will <strong>rise</strong> steadily as long as people go to work.<br>
You build new structures <strong>at a cost</strong> of the stock price<br>
When a typhoon becomes too close to Hong Kong, the stock price  <strong>goes down sharply</strong> too.<br>
When <strong>HSI becomes zero</strong>, the game is over as the economy of Hong Kong is at stake.</p>

<h2>Controls</h2>

<ol class="task-list">
<li>Click icon to select structure (Alternate: use keyboard shortcut)<br>
</li>
<li>Click on the map to build</li>
</ol>

<h2>Structures</h2>

<p>you have<br>
3 types of offensive towers,<br>
2 types of power plants, and<br>
3 types of research structures.</p>

<h3>Where to build</h3>

<p>Offensive towers must be built on sea, the others on land.<br>
All structures rely on power. you can see the power requirements by pointing your mouse cursor over the build button (when you can build it)</p>

<h3>Power</h3>

<p>Towers need <strong>power</strong> to attack.<br>
Power plants generate power <strong>quota</strong>, towers consume power.<br>
The available power is shown in the <strong>top right corner</strong><br>
If power quota is not enough for the towers, there is a <strong>power outage</strong> and ALL towers will not shoot.<br>
Inside the game, you can see how much power each structure needs by pointing your cursor at the button.</p>

<h2>Towers (Built on the sea)</h2>

<p>You start with the basic LaserTower. As you build more research structures, new towers are unlocked and existing towers get upgraded.</p>

<h3>Laser Tower</h3>

<p>Shoots laser at typhoon, disrupting local temperature and reduce typhoon strength. </p>

<ul class="task-list">
<li>Hotkey: 1</li>
<li>Requires: None</li>
<li>Power consumption: Low</li>
</ul>

<h3>Freeze Tower</h3>

<p>Shoots cold air at typhoon, reducing it movement speed</p>

<ul class="task-list">
<li>Hotkey: 3</li>
<li>Requires: University</li>
<li>Power consumption: Medium</li>
</ul>

<h3>Repel Tower</h3>

<p>Exerts a repel force at 1 typhoon around it. It may push the entire typhoon away (or the other way?) depends on how you place it.</p>

<ul class="task-list">
<li>Hotkey: 4</li>
<li>Requires: Research Center</li>
<li>Power consumption: High</li>
</ul>

<h2>Power Plants (Built on land)</h2>

<p>You start with the basic PowerPlant, and you can unlock the nuclear powerplant later.</p>

<h3>Power Plant</h3>

<p>Generates power that can hold a few LaserTower.</p>

<ul class="task-list">
<li>Hotkey: 1</li>
<li>Requires: None</li>
<li>Power production: Medium</li>
</ul>

<h3>Nuclear Power Plant</h3>

<p>Generates more power than the normal one, but it is also much more expensive because it takes less space.</p>

<ul class="task-list">
<li>Hotkey: Q</li>
<li>Requires: Research Center</li>
<li>Power production: High</li>
</ul>

<h2>Tech Building (Built on land)</h2>

<p>These tech buildings have quite a cost, but having them will unlock all sorts of power for your defense system.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> You only need 1 of each tech structure to have their powers. Effects don't stack.</p>

<h3>University</h3>

<p>It unlocks the freeze tower, and it upgrades LaserTowers in range and flat damage, and increases cost</p>

<ul class="task-list">
<li>Hotkey: W</li>
<li>Requires: None</li>
<li>Power consumption: High</li>
</ul>

<h3>Research Center</h3>

<p>Unlocks The RepelTower,<br>
further increases LaserTower range, damage and cost,<br>
as well as FreezeTower slowrate, range, damage and cost</p>

<ul class="task-list">
<li>Hotkey: E</li>
<li>Requires: University</li>
<li>Power consumption: High</li>
</ul>

<h3>Cheung Kong Headquarters</h3>

<p>Upgrades Repel tower, increasing range, force, cost.
Also doubles HSI increase Rate.</p>

<ul class="task-list">
<li>Hotkey: R</li>
<li>Requires: ResearchCenter</li>
<li>Power consumption: Very High</li>
</ul>
